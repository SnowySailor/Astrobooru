  h1 Browsing Filters
  p
    ' Images posted on the site are tagged, allowing you to easily search for content. You can also filter out content you'd rather not see using filters. Filters are sets of tags - spoilered tags and hidden tags. Spoilers are images that show up as thumbnails instead of the image, letting you click through and find out more about an image before deciding to view it or not. Hidden tags will simply hide images.
  p
    ' There are set of global filters to pick from which cover some common use-cases.
    ' If you're logged in you can also customize these filters and make your own, as well as quickly switch (via the menu on every page) between them.

  p
    ' By default all the filters you create are private and only visible by you. You can have as many as you like and switch between them instantly with no limits. You can also create a public filter, which can be seen and used by any user on the site, allowing you to share useful filters with others.
